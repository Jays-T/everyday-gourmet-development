# User Stories

1. "As an **event planner** I'm planning the menu for a wedding and I need to quickly find a good wine pairing for the second course."
1. "As a **wine afficionado** I love trying new wines and pretending to be able to discern the ingredients by swirling the wine around my glass and then tasting the wines bouquet."
1. "As a **random user** I'm interested to know what 'Everyday Gourmet' means."
1. "As a **domestic partner** I want to make absolutely sure I pair tomorrow evenings dinner with a great tasting wine!"
1. "As a **frequent lunch and/or dinner party host** I need to pair the right wine with this weekends lunch, after last times disaster I think I'll do a search online for some suggestions."

# My Strategy

* My goal was to ensure the information was easy to access while striving for a responsive and elegant design.

# Structure

* I wanted the landing page to be fairly minimalistic and elegant but also make it easy for the user to quickly get straight to the main purpose and service of the site.

* From the landing page the user can scroll manually down to reveal the wine pairing service, or they can click on the "wine pairing" link in the Navbar
* Links to the Contact and Shop Local are also in the Navbar and from each of those two pages the user can easy navigate back to the home/landing page area and the pairing wines service area and either the contact or shop local page, depending on which page the user is on.

# User Interface
* My design choices were based on the owner goals of communicating a feeling of elegance and simplicity and the user goals of wanting to quickly access and make use of the sites main services.
* I went with a pallette of slightly offwhite text juxtaposed against a dark background with thin offred borders.
* For the main sections I went with the same color combinations playing light against dark with semi-transparent backgrounds over vibrantly colored images of various fruits, cheeses and wine.
* My design choices in the main sections were based on maintaining a feeling of elegance, simplicity, but also a sense of occasion... to make every day, Gourmet!

* Fonts I chose are:
  * <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat/" target="_blank">Montserrat</a> with a font-weight of 300. I used this font for all the text content on the site except for the word 'Gourmet' the 'C' in the 'close' button at the bottom of the wine suggestion modal and the names of the three wines returned as a suggestion to the user.
  * <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yellowtail/" target="_blank">Yellowtail</a> used for the word 'Gourmet' and the 'C' in the 'close' button at the bottom of the wine suggestion modal.
  * <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora" target="_blank">Lora</a> used only to style the names of the wine suggestions returned from the wine pairing service.

# Features

* Automated wine pairing service: allows the User to select a food type and get a suggestion for three types of wines to pair with their selection, the information returned includes buttons with the text 'Shop' which include links to the types of wines suggested which will open in a new tab and take the user to wine.com with a search having already been performed for the specific type of wine they clicked "shop" on.
* Email service: allows the User to contact the site owner.
* Shop locally service: allows the User to do a search for 'wines near me' or in reality anything the User might wish to search for in relation to google.maps allowed searches.

# Scope

* The current scope of the project is limited, users have a limited number of food selection options. The reason for this is simply due to the nature of the project, the level of my current coding skills, and the limited time to complete the project. I didn't want to overcommit myself and so I kept the scope of the project within what I felt was currenty achievable.

# Testing

* All HTML validated with <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">w3 validator</a>
* All CSS validated with <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">w3 css validator</a>

* Some parsing errors were found by the css validator within the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/apply-a-filter-to-a-background-image/" target="_blank">Image Overlay</a> - solution by Dan Wilson that I used. I will address those issues in future iterations of this project, none of the css issues caused any major errors on the site

## This site has been tested manually

Browsers tested: 
* Chrome
* Microsoft Edge

Phones tested: 
* Huawei P20Lite
* iPhone 6
* Xaomi Mi 9

* Site also tested with Chrome's built in 'Inspect Element' preview panes simulating the iPad Pro, iPad, iPhone X, iPhone 6/7/8 plus, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 5 SE, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 2 and Galaxy S5
* JS and jQuery code tested on <a href="https://www.repl.it " target="_blank">ReplIt</a>
* Entire site tested extensively with console log and found to only return an error on major bug #1(See <a href="#bugs">Known Bugs</a>)
* All inter-site links tested on all pages across devices and found to be working
* All outward links directed at other sites tested and found to be working and opening in a new tab
* All links populated on wine suggestion modal found to be correctly targetted and opening in a new tab
* While watching the console log in real time, no major errors were found across the site apart from major bug #1(See <a href="#bugs">Known Bugs</a>)


# Bugs

**Major Bugs**
* Bug #1: if user select == 'Choose...' : **Bug Description** In the Choose Food section if the option 'Choose...' is chosen, the code will break and return wines #2 and #3 from the previous selection. The user will have to refresh the page in order for the food select/wine pairing function to work correctly again. This bug re-occurred on every device tested.
  * Bug #1 status:  Unresolved
* Bug #2: form auto-clear : **Bug Description** On the contact page after sending an email the email form does not automatically clear itself.
  * Bug #2 status:  Unresolved
**Minor Bugs**
* Minor Bug #1: smooth-scroll : **Bug Description** On some devices, notably the Huawei P20 Lite, the smooth-scroll function sometimes does not scroll all the way to the bottom of the landing page. The bug was only encountered occasionally and most noticeably when the phone seemed to be under load having immediately previously executed some other function.
  * Ways to possibly re-create the bug based on site testing: 
  * Immediately after the home landing page loads after clicking through from another page on the site clicking on "wine pairing" in the navbar may re-produce this bug.
  * While using a different app entirely, quickly switching to the browser on the device and immediately after the browser has opened clicking on the "wine pairing" in the navbar may re-produce this bug.
  * Bug status: Unresolved

# Deployment

* This project and all project files are hosted on GitHub via my GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/Jays-T/everyday-gourmet" target="_blank">Everyday Gourmet Repository</a>
* I coded the project using GitPod as my development environment. 
* To deploy the project 
   1. I began by adding the files using the command 'git add filename' in the command prompt.
   2. I then used commits regularly while coding using the command 'git commit -m "commit message here". 
   3. I then pushed the committed files from the GitPod IDE to the master branch of the main repository on GitHub.
   4. After pushing the files I went to my repository.
   5. I clicked on the 'Settings' tab near the top of the page and scrolled down to the 'GitHub Pages' section.
   6. I selected the Source as the 'Master Branch' as all the site content and files are stored in and built from the 'Master Branch'.
   7. GitHub provided me with a direct link to the deployed site.
   8. You can view the deployed site here: <a href="https://jays-t.github.io/everyday-gourmet/" target="_blank">Everyday Gourmet</a>

## There are no differences between the currently deployed site and the development version at this time.

# To preview in your browser

If you are using gitpod as your IDE:
The project runs only from the Master branch the main directory of which is:  /workspace/everyday-gourmet
When in the main directory enter the following into the command prompt
1. python3 -m http.server
2. This will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000.
3. If you are working in Gitpod this will give you an option to 'open browser' which will open the default 'index.html'
4. If you want to stop the local server from running simply press crtl + C

## Acknowledgements

## Thank you SO SO MUCH to my mentor **@rheyannmagcalas_mentor** for all the help and great tips she gave me while I was developing and then working on this project and for helping me to finally solve the issue with my API GET script... I agonized for 5 days unable to get it to work and in the end it was such a simple fix and I was overcomplicating my code.
## Thank you to h4xnoodle for your advice and consistently reminding me not to overcomplicate things.
